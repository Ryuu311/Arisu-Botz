# Reinzz WhatsApp Bot

Hello! 👋  
I'm **Reinzz**, a beginner developer and a student who is currently learning JavaScript and bot development.
This is one of my personal projects where I try to build my own WhatsApp bot using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) — a powerful library for connecting WhatsApp Web with Node.js.

## 📌 About This Project

This project is my way of learning how bots work, especially on WhatsApp. I’m still exploring a lot of things like:

- How to handle commands
- How to work with APIs
- Sending media, stickers, and buttons
- Creating modular code
- Experimenting with different features like menus, stalking, downloader, games, etc.

Even though I'm still learning, I'm doing my best to write clean and organized code.
